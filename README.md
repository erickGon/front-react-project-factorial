# front-react-project-factorial
â€œWe want a Front-end + Backend application that allows you to post and visualize metrics. Each metric will have a Timestamp, name, and value. The metrics will be shown in a timeline and must show averages per minute/hour/day. The metrics will be persisted in the database.
